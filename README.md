### Download just the game ROM: [tdgbd.gb](/bin/tdgbd.gb)

### [Play it in the browser](https://taylorplewe.github.io/tdgbd/)

Higher quality video: [https://youtu.be/AHXYl89QJTo](https://youtu.be/AHXYl89QJTo)

Written in Sharp LR35902 assembly (nearly identical to z80 assembly)

Much help from [gbdev.io](https://gbdev.io/pandocs/)

> *NOTE: For best results, use an emulator like [Mesen](https://mesen.ca) or [higan](https://github.com/higan-emu/higan/releases) that prioritize emulation accuracy; emulators like binjgb or Visual Boy Advance do not calculate object priority correctly, and the player shadow will not be masked by certain background objects like it's supposed to and will look funny*
